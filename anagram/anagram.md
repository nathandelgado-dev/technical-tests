# Anagram
## How is anagram?
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Create a function that receives two strings and returns boolean true if both strings are anagrams and false if they are not.

**Conditions:**
- Receive two strings.
- You must compare words and sentences.
- Must receive uppercase and lowercase letters.
