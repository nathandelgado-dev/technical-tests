# Different Numbers
Your development team has been asked by the client to perform an indexing and storage optimization algorithm on the inventory process.

However, the team has problems with a method that they do not know how to perform optimally and they have asked you for help to solve it.

Following the Single Responsibility Principle SRP, you are going to build a function whose sole responsibility is to calculate the number of different numbers within a given list.

## Function Description
The function receives an array of tasks, and should return the number of unique values that exist.

## Example Case
### Input
`[5, 3, 5, 2, 5]`
### Output
`3`
### Explanation
If we have tasks with duration 5, 3, 5, 2 y 5.
`5, 2, 3 are the different elements`
